# inipp
A simple INI file parser - header only

#### Usage
Copy the inipp header and source files and you are good to go.

The implementation for this one is very crude, nothing fancy that has been used.

#### Help
The main source code contains a sample implementation of the same headers, so please feel free to test it.

Please suggest ways of improvement and feel free to extend the same for any purpose.
